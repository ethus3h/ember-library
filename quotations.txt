"What is it with people assuming all girls are insecure about their looks? I mean, a lot of girls are but it's kind of stupid that it's just expected. I don't think I'm pretty, I'm kinda average looking and a bit fat, but I'm not insecure about it. Don't get me wrong, I have TONS of insecurities, but my looks are basically the only thing about myself I'm not insecure about. I find it so funny when I say I think I'm fat everyone just freaks out telling me I'm beautiful and I'm just sitting there wondering what I should watch after lunch. The weird part is that it happens about things that I actually like about myself too. I've got a pretty square figure and whenever I mention it people always assure me I don't and I'm just like "but I want a square figure though?" And they just get confused. I don't know, beauty standards are bullshit and we should all just dress and do out hair however we damn well please.﻿" —rogue123987, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBqSFcv11b4&lc=z135cbh4gun1hhfy004cfzhi3rrwzlgptik
