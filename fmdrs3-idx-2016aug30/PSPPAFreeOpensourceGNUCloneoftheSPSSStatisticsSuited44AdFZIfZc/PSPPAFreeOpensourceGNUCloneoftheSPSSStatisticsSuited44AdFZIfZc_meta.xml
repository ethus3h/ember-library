  <description>SPSS is expensive and full of nag screens. Being that I use Linux and am an open source advocate, I searched and found this alternative for my classes. While my school may have SPSS in the lab, I really don't want to work in the lab for various reasons. After demonstrating this app to my professor, it seems there is a chance my school may switch to using it anyway. Take a look and give it a try!
