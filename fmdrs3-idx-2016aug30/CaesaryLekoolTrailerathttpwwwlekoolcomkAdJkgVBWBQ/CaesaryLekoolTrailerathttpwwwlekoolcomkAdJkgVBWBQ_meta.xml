Caesary is a browser based game, which means no download is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.lekool.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caesary is based on the history of the Roman Empire, the post-Republican phase of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by an autocratic form of government and large territorial holdings in Europe and around the Mediterranean.
